# WP-GDPR-Cookies

WordPress plugin for cookie notice and conditionally including JS functions like Google Analytics

## How to use

Requirements: ACF PRO plugin, Bootstrap 5: modal, nav-pills (nav), custom switches (forms->form check)

1. Under Custom tools->Tools import ACF JSON file which you can find in plugin folder /acf (Currently I don't want to include the code automatically)
2. Enter the content under GDPR menu
3. Include logo in the plugin and perhaps change or override color variables in CSS
